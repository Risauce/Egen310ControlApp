# Developer Documentation

## General Information

This project contains the source code and documentation required to operate a remote control vehicle. The source code both contains both the .aia (the app code built in MIT App inventor) and the arduino sketch code (the code that runs within the arduino on our vehicle). 

## Developer Tools

  - In order to use this project you must first get access to it's files. Clone this repository or download the .zip file with it's contents. 

- From here, you can use your own Arduino IDE to install the Main.ino file onto your Arduino. Feel free to make any changes you like, for this code works specifically with my machine.

- You will also need to obtain the .apk (Android application package) of the Control app. You can install the .apk onto your android device to use the developed control app. This .apk can be found in the /build directory, along with the .aia.
