# Developer Documentation

## General Information

This project contains the source code and documentation required to operate a remote control vehicle. The source code both contains both the .aia (the app code built in MIT App inventor) and the arduino sketch code (the code that runs within the arduino on our vehicle). 

## Developer Tools

  - In order to use this project you must first get access to it's files. Clone this repository or download the .zip file with it's contents. 

- From here, you can use your own Arduino IDE to install the Main.ino file onto your Arduino. Feel free to make any changes you like, for this code works specifically with my machine.

- You will also need to obtain the .apk (Android application package) of the Control app. You can install the .apk onto your android device to use the developed control app. This .apk can be found in the /build directory, along with the .aia.

- The .aia is the code of the control app itself, however the only way to change/work on this source code is to upload the .aia to the [MIT App Inventor website](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/). You will need an account, and once you enter the website you can find under *My Projects* the option to import the .aia into the creator. 

### Source Code:

- The source code for our development can be found here: [Development Code](https://github.com/Risauce/Egen310ControlApp)

- Check the releases tab of the Github repo for code seperated by release. 

## Bugs Reporting: 

- How to access bug lists: To report a bug navigate to the *issues* section of the Github repo and create a new issue. Make sure to properly name the bug and describe exactly your issue before creating the issue. 
- Ensure that the issue is also properly labeled, so that developers can easily determine what an issue is among the list of others.  Currently, no user reported bug lists exist. Resolved and unresolved developer Issues can be viewed on Github.
