# User Documentation

## General Information

Welcome to group F.11's Control App User Documentation. This short guide will give you the information required to both utilize and/or grade this RCV control app! 

The basic setup of this project consists mostly of two major files. The Control App itself is built up of 

1. An android application package (.apk). This file installs the app onto your android mobile device, and,
2. An arduino sketch. This file is installed onto an arduino microprocessor (an Arduino Uno for our project) and runs commands on the vechile itself to recieve input from the app mentioned above.
